<p>During this fall semester, I've been working on several mediums such as digital image, digital video, audio, and especially coding which is a totally new language to me. This is my very first experience working on these mediums, except Photoshop. I've been so excited whenever I explore something new from working on art 74 projects. The most interesting medium for me is editing videos which is also my main focus in this class. Since I wanted to make videos long time ago, I'm so happy that I've been taught how to do that in 74 class. The two videos in my portfolio are also my first two videos I've ever made (the final project will be the third). In addition, most of my projects are based on my daily life as well as my hobbies (food or playing instruments).</p>
<br>
<p>Besides, I've met many problems during the processes. For example, since it was my first time learning how to code, it was so difficult to me to create my Net Art Site as well as my p5.js project (fishing game). However, now I'm get used to coding language and I think I will make more of these.   </p>

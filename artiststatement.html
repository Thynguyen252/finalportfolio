<p>During this fall semester, I worked on several mediums such as digital image, digital video, audio, and especially coding which is a totally new language to me. It was my very first experience working on these mediums, except Photoshop. The most interesting medium to me was editing videos which was also my main focus in this class. I had the same process for all projects. For example, I built the main ideas first and decided which one to work on. This idea has to be catchy and new for myself because I really want to challenge myself with something that I haven't tried before. Second, I developed the idea with possible ways, sometimes it just came to my mind, but sometimes I needed time to observe around to look for ideas.  </p>

<p>To be specific, for my final project B.L.I.N.K, I wanted to make a stop motion video which I never did before. After watching some tutorials on Youtube, I made a list of possible ideas for the video. I wanted to make something with colors, so I decided to choose my makeups because they have quite the same color tone (pink and black). Next, I built a little studio box to take photos of the objects to create sequences for the footages. Then, I added some texts, effects, and sound that I recored my own voice to the video. I had some difficulties during the process, but more importantly, I learned something new.  </p>

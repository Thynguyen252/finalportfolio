  <p>HIDDEN GARDEN, DIGITAL IMAGE, 2019</P>
  <br>
  <p>This is a glitched digital image. The original photo was shotÂ at Santa Cruz beach and the model is my friend sitting in the middle of the bush. This photo was originally so green, so I decided to add to it more colors. I used the Audacity sound editing software and Photoshop to change the color and add glitch effects.</p>

  <p>ASTRONAUT SPARTAN, DIGITAL IMAGE, 2019</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is a digital composite image edited in Photoshop. In terms of changing the environment of SJSU campus, I cut off some buildings and moved them out of space where students can meet three friendly astronauts.</p>

  <p>COLORFUL GRID, NET ART, 2019.</P>
  <br>
  <p>My Net Art is a personal website with my drawings, a video, and photos. Each medium is presented on separated page, but same concept which is colorful grid. Through this Net Art, I want to share my hobbies as well as some of my works that I really like.</p>

  <p>CHILL NIGHT, COMPOSITE SOUND, 1:00, 2019.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is a combination of 3 sounds that I recorded in a silent night: The piano I played, the train, and the on/off button of my lamp. I used the Audacity sound editing software to combine these sound together to create a track.</p>

  <p>FISHING, INTERACTIVE NET ART, 2019.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is a net art piece which is made with p5.js program to create a fishing game. The game is done by clicking to the screen. If the mouse is above the school fish, it'll turn to bubble. If the mouse is below the fish, it'll turn to the sushi.</p>

  <p>IT WAS A WINDY DAY, DIGITAL VIDEO, 1:43, 2019.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is my first video ever! These footages were originally filmed in Santa Cruz. It was so windy on that day; thus, I named my video "It was a windy day". The background music is my singing in Vietnamese with my ukulele and combined with the wind sound.</p>

  <p>B.L.I.N.K, DIGITAL VIDEO, 2:00, 2019.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My final project for art74 class is a stop motion video. This video is about the contrast between pink and black. I choose my makeups to represent the two colors. There are 3 parts in the video: pink, black, blink (which is combination of pink and black, but also means "blink"). The video also has the relationship and interaction between the objects. To do so, I add some animation effects and sound to make the objects alive.</p>
